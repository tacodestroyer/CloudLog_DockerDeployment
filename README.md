# CloudLog_DockerDeployment
A docker deployment for CloudLog 

## Cloudlog

[Cloudlog](https://www.magicbug.co.uk/cloudlog/) is an open-source PHP & MySQL based amateur radio logging application, allowing you to log contacts via a web browser on any device and platform.

This is an ideal general-purpose logging application, supporting HF to Microwave, it can even interface with your radio via CAT, sync logs from WSJT-X & if you are a satellite operator integrates with SatPC32.

## The Idea

Well, it really came down to the trouble getting it stood up that I was having...I figured that once I got it going, I could create a docker image that could be distributed/shared and would save some headaches for future folks. Plus, it gives me a good excuse to practice my docker image creation skills.
